                <p id="intro"> To be honest, I'm not sure if this is a bad thing or a great thing (well, of course I think it's a great thing!!).
                    I am fascinated by food. The even more mind blowing thing is, I know that there are so many varieties of food that I 
                    haven't even tried yet. There are so many unknown cultures that have amazing traditional food!!! Why can't I enjoy 
                    my own fair share!! Anyways this is my list of all of my favorite foods and some ones I would love to try!!!

                          There is nothing like a good american burger. Often times I feel like alot of people who eat
                          burgers are bias in regards of quality and taste of the beef and are blinded by the condiments
                          and toppings that are included or requested. To be honest though I'm so in love with burgers 
                          times I will settle for a below average burger just to fulfill my craving lol smh.

                          I have always been in love with hispanic cuisine. One of the main reasons is because of the variety
                          that comes with eating hispanic food. I can easily say that I love street tacos the most but the next
                          day, I'll go to a friends house and get blow away by the enchaladas that was made. I get the slightest
                          feeling that there is more out there than what I've had so far. Sounds like its time to experiment!!

                          I feel, well at least for me, living in Seattle we have tons to choose from when it comes to asian food.
                          Especially for me growing up with alot of my friends being Phillpino or Cambodian etc. I have had the 
                          opportunity to try so many different types of asian food, or I could also say food from the pacific island.
                          All I do know is, growing up with the friends I have makes me want to travel throughout Asia and just eat allll

                          introduce this wonderful pie full of flavor. Mmmhhmmm I would also like to shout out Domino's and Pizza Hut pizza
                          for being in competition for who's has the best carryout deals on large 3 toppings lol. Lastly I would like to give
                          a final shout out to Big Marios pizza in Cap Hill for always provided my stomach with the deliciously regretful calories
                          on those drunk late nights! Much appreciated!! =]

                          I know they're probably the simplest entree I've talked about so far, but they have played a vital part in my life thus 
                          far! From starting out only eating Subway to eating Quizno's to going to QFC for a sandwich on my lunch to making them 
                          at my house to not spend money. I've always loved a good sandwich. The main thing I love about sandwiches are you can 
                          dress them however you like!! At QFC the employees would make fun of me because I would put turkey tuna and chicken on
                          my sandwich lol. I don't care though I think its dish delish! In my opinion thats makes it all the worth wild.

                            I honestly this is probably the only thing I look forward to before going to sleep. As well as helping me wake up early
                            in the morning so I don't end up missing it. I just recently tried out egg benedict and I fell in love with it so much 
                            that I started making it myself! Thanks to chef Ramsey and my love for flavor I think my benedict is competing with anybody.

                            I used to always think sushi was disgusting back then. In my head I'm thinking why would want to eat something thats undercooked.
                            I was thinking wouldn't this increase the mercury intake(of course no). Anyways I went with a friend who said she loves it and 
                            I went through the menu and fortunately I found some fried items and they were amazing! I mean I guess this could mean that maybe 
                            I'm still not a fan of sushi other than the friend items ha. I'm not sure but hopefully one day I'll try something actually raw.

                            I feel like you just need to be lucky and know somebody or know the spots to go to, to get some good southern cuisine.
                            Especially in Seattle where the options and places are scattered and not easily publicized or marketed. If you happen to find a place,
                            thumbs up to you because the food is absolutely amazing if it is made correctly and made with love. If I had someone to cook soul food 
                            for me daily I would definitely be a "Big Boy" lol. It's definitely heavy food you probably could eat one setting of it and your done for
